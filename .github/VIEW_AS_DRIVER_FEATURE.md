# View As Driver Feature - Admin Troubleshooting Tool

## Overview
The "View As Driver" feature allows administrators to impersonate driver accounts for troubleshooting purposes. This lets admins see exactly what a driver sees without needing their password.

## Key Features

### 1. **Session-Based Impersonation**
- Admin can switch to a driver's view without logging out
- Original admin session is preserved in session storage
- Admin can return to their account with one click

### 2. **Visual Indicators**
- **Red banner** appears at top of every page when impersonating
- Banner shows:
  - Current driver username and name
  - Original admin username
  - "Exit View As" button

### 3. **Security Restrictions**
- Only staff members can use this feature (`@staff_member_required`)
- Cannot impersonate other staff or admin users
- All impersonation actions are logged

### 4. **Audit Trail**
- System creates notification when impersonation starts
- Tracks:
  - Who impersonated whom
  - When it started
  - How long the session lasted

## How to Use

### Starting Impersonation
1. Go to Admin ‚Üí User Search
2. Find the driver you want to troubleshoot
3. Click **"üîç View As Driver"** button
4. Confirm the action
5. You'll be redirected to the driver's profile page

### While Impersonating
- You see exactly what the driver sees
- Red warning banner at top shows you're in admin mode
- You can navigate the entire site as the driver
- All permissions are the driver's (not yours)

### Ending Impersonation
1. Click **"Exit View As ‚Üí Return to [your username]"** in the red banner
2. You'll be logged back in as admin
3. Redirected to Admin User Search page
4. Success message shows duration of impersonation

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### 1. `accounts/views.py`
- `view_as_driver(request, user_id)` - Starts impersonation
- `stop_impersonation(request)` - Ends impersonation and restores admin session

#### 2. `accounts/urls.py`
```python
path("admin/users/<int:user_id>/view-as/", views.view_as_driver, name="view_as_driver"),
path("admin/stop-impersonation/", views.stop_impersonation, name="stop_impersonation"),
```

#### 3. `accounts/context_processors.py`
- `impersonation_status(request)` - Makes impersonation state available to all templates

#### 4. `truckincentive/settings.py`
- Added `"accounts.context_processors.impersonation_status"` to context processors

#### 5. `templates/base.html`
- Added red warning banner that appears during impersonation
- Shows current user and exit button

#### 6. `templates/accounts/admin_user_search.html`
- Added "View As Driver" button to driver actions

## Session Data Structure

During impersonation, these session keys are set:
```python
{
    'impersonate_id': 123,  # Original admin user ID
    'impersonate_username': 'admin_user',  # Original admin username
    'impersonate_started': '2025-10-28T15:30:00'  # ISO format timestamp
}
```

## Use Cases

### 1. **Troubleshoot Display Issues**
- Driver reports points not showing correctly
- Admin views as driver to see their exact view
- Can verify points, orders, notifications

### 2. **Test Permissions**
- Verify what features driver can/cannot access
- Check sponsor-specific visibility
- Confirm catalog filtering works correctly

### 3. **Reproduce Bugs**
- Driver reports "button doesn't work"
- Admin views as driver to reproduce exact scenario
- Can test with driver's actual data

### 4. **Verify Fixes**
- After fixing a driver-specific issue
- Admin impersonates to confirm fix works
- No need to ask driver to test

### 5. **Training & Demonstrations**
- Show other admins how driver view looks
- Document workflows from driver perspective
- Create screenshots for help documentation

## Limitations

### What You CAN Do
‚úÖ View all pages the driver can access
‚úÖ See their profile, points, orders
‚úÖ Navigate catalog as they see it
‚úÖ View their notifications and messages
‚úÖ Test UI interactions

### What You CANNOT Do
‚ùå Impersonate other admins or staff
‚ùå Change the driver's password while impersonating
‚ùå Delete the driver's account
‚ùå Bypass normal permission checks

## Best Practices

1. **Always inform drivers** when possible before impersonating
2. **Document why** you're impersonating in support tickets
3. **Keep sessions short** - only as long as needed to troubleshoot
4. **Exit immediately** after resolving the issue
5. **Review audit logs** regularly to track impersonation usage

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot impersonate staff or admin users"
- This is intentional - only driver accounts can be impersonated
- Use regular admin access for staff account issues

### Banner not showing
- Clear browser cache
- Check context processor is registered in settings
- Verify session data exists: `request.session.get('impersonate_id')`

### Can't exit impersonation
- Manually clear session: Delete `impersonate_*` keys
- Or log out and log back in as admin

### Session expired during impersonation
- Original admin session data lost
- Must log in again normally
- Consider increasing `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE` in settings

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Add impersonation history page (who impersonated whom and when)
- [ ] Restrict certain actions during impersonation (e.g., can't purchase items)
- [ ] Add "read-only mode" option
- [ ] Email notification to driver when impersonation occurs
- [ ] Time limit for impersonation sessions
- [ ] Require justification text before impersonating

## Security Considerations

- Only staff can access this feature
- Cannot impersonate privileged accounts
- All actions are logged with timestamps
- Session data includes original admin identity
- Original admin session is restored (not a new login)
- Impersonation state is visible at all times (red banner)
